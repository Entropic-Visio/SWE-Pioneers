The purpose of this document is to clearly outline our company’s ethics, views, and rules, which we must all adhere to. These rules and guidelines provide a fair and respectful workplace where colleagues are treated with respect and are free to express intellectual thoughts.

This will foster a positive workplace environment for our employees and workers, as well as create a high workflow and organized company.

## Core Principles
The core philosophy of our company is that each of our employees must have empowerment and accountability, this means that they are expected to take initiative, and own their projects. We expect our employees to meet these tasks which were set out by the organization as a whole, if any difficulties appear we expect the employee to clearly communicate with others during meetings and discussion. 

### Empowerment
One of the core philosophies of our company is that we expect each of our employees to have empowerment and accountability. Empowerment means that we allow the individual the right of initiative, allowing them to make their own decisions and voice their opinions for the good of the company. As a company we also provide the employee with resources and tools to help them achieve goals which are tasked by the company.

We also expect our employees to take accountability. Meaning whatever the outcome of the task they have been set out to do is solely their responsibility and must take blame whether good or bad. 

### Communication and Transparency
We expect our peers to have transparency and clear communication with the company and colleagues. We follow this conduct by holding two types of meetings. A weekly meeting and a daily meeting.

**Purpose of Weekly Meetings**
The objectives of the weekly meetings are to ensure that everyone in the group is well informed of plans for current sprints.

A typical meeting would include extensive preparation, planning, and coordination. We expect our colleagues and employees to bring light to any issues which have arised in their work and communicate properly to peers. 

Weekly meetings will be held on Wednesday 2pm to 4pm.

Examples of weekly meetings topics:
- Preparation for Future Sprints
- Planning for Future Sprints
- Any issues which is occurring for sprints
- Backlog management

**Purpose of Daily Meetings**
The purpose of daily meetings is to keep track of progress for our current sprints. This also provides grounds for immediate attention for any problems our employees have, and provides grounds to voice them amongst others.

Examples of daily meeting topics:
- Issues which are current in the sprint
- Current progress in the sprint
- Any immediate issues and problems

Daily meetings will last only 15 minutes.


## Reward and Punishments
As a company we value our employees and we provide them the ability to take accountability. This also comes with a system of reward and punishment. Depending on the employee's merit will determine whether they are punished or rewarded. There are different punishments and different levels of severities for the punishments. Punishments can be minor, moderate or severe depending on the offense. Upon successful sprint completion we'll organize an after-party and celebrate and bond together. We will hold a plethora of events which can be discussed by the team. 

### Reward System
Upon the successful completion of each sprint, all employees will be invited to an after party on a decided day. We will celebrate and discuss how we found the sprint and have a better understanding of our weaknesses and strengths will provide a strong bonding session. Employees can have access to various activities and in-house events such as going to café together, and buying coffee for employees or playing sports together. We believe that team bonding is an important aspect of any organization and collaborative work. 

### Punishment System
As we expect our employees to take accountability of failure to meet the required task or failure to inform others of issues and problems. Therefore in placement we have a punishment system in place to make sure that our colleagues work up to speed with others. Though a cruel methodology we must make sure that everyone pulls their own weight. We have multiple levels of punishments

- Minor
- Moderate
- Severe


**Minor - Light Warnings & Punishments**
Minor punishment category covers things such as being 1-10 minutes late to a meeting. 
Miscommunication in the project and incoherency 

The reprimand for this would be that the person must act out a random animal for 3 minutes.

**Moderate Punishment - More Serious Punishment But Does Not Warrant a Severe Punishment**
When someone misses out on a meeting they would be required to do additional research of the topic or discussion they missed out on. 

Educational Task - They would require you to do a brief essay on a topic which is relevant to the company.

**Severe Punishments - Highest Level of Punishment**
Severe punishment is for punishment which has affected the group on a large scale. Such as failure to communicate a major aspect of your code, failure to provide a satisfactory result in regard to a project or assignment.

Reflective Essay & Supervision - They would be required to write a reflective essay on why they have failed to do the tasked work and will be supervised until satisfactory work is done.


### Closing Statement

We recognize that the document is not absolute and welcome suggestions for its enhancement and improvement. We welcome suggestions for its enhancement. We expect your workers to build a healthy work environment which thrives of collaboration. We want to achieve these goals through mutual respect and great effort.
